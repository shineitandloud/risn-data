RISN Product Design Data Reshind — Response 3

This repository is part of the RISN Brand's backend design infrastructure. Response 3 automates the reshaping (“reshind”) of all product design data—preparing it for seamless use across generative AI tools, marketing rollouts, and visual asset pipelines.

Purpose

The reshind process systematically reorganizes raw and AI-generated product design data into a clean, structured format that powers:

Visual content generation (Midjourney, Gemini)

Campaign automation (YouTube Shorts, Threads, etc.)

Internal style/version control

Consistent cross-platform brand visuals
